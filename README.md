# vci

## Prerequisites: 
have a working docker-compose setup (this was tested on mac), might need user/login to docker.com etc.

```
make prepare # checks out vespa sample-apps
```

## 0. create docker-compose cluster with 1x admin, 2x stateless and 2x content nodes (tested on macos)

```
make ci
```

Sample output: see [output0_from_starting_vespa_cluster_before_application.txt](output0_from_starting_vespa_cluster_before_application.txt)


## 1. update /etc/hosts on all nodes in cluster (in addition to built in dns)
```
make cihosts
```

Sample output: see [output1_from_creating_etc_hosts_file_on_all_nodes.txt](output1_from_creating_etc_hosts_file_on_all_nodes.txt)

## 2. deploy (basic-search) application on docker-compose cluster 
```
make runci
```

Sample output: see [output2_from_deploying_application_cluster.txt](output2_from_deploying_application_cluster.txt)

## 3. login into admin node and check cluster state
```
make shell
[root@admin0 vespascripts]# /opt/vespa/bin/vespa-get-cluster-state 

Cluster music:
music/distributor/0: up
music/distributor/1: up
music/storage/0: up
music/storage/1: up
```
